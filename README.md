# JS-Project

I have say
This is comment box project
This id developed only by using pure JS 
One comment box and an ADD button is there
After adding some text in comment box when we click on add button this will show you that comment below the comment box in list
That list also contain reply, like and delete buttons
Likely you clicks on reply again will provide you another textbox to reply that parent comment
Like button will increase the like count
Delete button will remove that enter comment with replies

Again that reply also have reply like and delete butoons and all thes buttons works as same as above mentioned
Any level we can reply
